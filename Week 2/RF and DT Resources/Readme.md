# Decision Trees and Random Forests 
This repository contains implementations and examples of decision trees and random forests, which are popular machine learning algorithms for classification and regression tasks.<br>

## Decision Tree 
Decision trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. They create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features

## Random Forests 
Random forests are an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve accuracy and control overfitting. They are widely used for classification, regression, and other tasks
