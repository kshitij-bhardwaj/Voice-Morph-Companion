# Clustering Algorithms
Clustering algorithms are a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups similar data points together. The goal is to find natural groupings within the data, where the data points within a group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. There are various clustering algorithms, including DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Model, Mean-Shift, K-Means, Agglomerative Hierarchy clustering, and OPTICS.
